## Milestone 2 

Created milestone_2.py to create the foundation of the program and creating the logic
for checking characters

Added basic IO functions from the code to create the workflow of the application. Uses
random to pick a word from the word list. Uses the `isalpha()` function to to know if letter
is alphabet without code bloat.

## Milestone 3

Created functions to make the code more reusable and organising code so only two 
functions are needed to run the program
